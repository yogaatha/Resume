<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Yoga — a Fullstack Developer who loves building things for the web. I enjoy working across the full stack, from designing clean, responsive interfaces to developing solid backend systems that make everything run smoothly.</p>

<p>On the backend, I focus on performance, security, and clean data flow using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Prisma ORM. On the frontend, I value responsive design, accessibility, and great user experience through component-based development and reusable UI patterns.</p>

<p>I’m always exploring new tools and best practices to stay aligned with current trends — from serverless deployment and CI/CD pipelines to integrating AI-powered APIs where they add real value. For me, full-stack development is about delivering systems that are not only functional but built to last.</p>
